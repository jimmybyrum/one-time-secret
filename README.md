# One Time Secret

VOTS allows you to share secrets securely with other team members or external parties. Once a secret has been viewed, it's gone, forever. No more sending secrets over Slack, email or shouting them out loud. For added security use the password feature and send the password and link separately to your recipient.

## Local setup
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
